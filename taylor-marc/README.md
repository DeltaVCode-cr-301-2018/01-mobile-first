# Project Name

**Author**: Taylor Robinson and Marc Hauschildt
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This application is a blog that utilizes &quot;Mobile First&quot; techniques to provide the user with a layout that looks good and is easy to use. The layout includes a mobile navigation &quot;hamburger&quot; icon that when clicked displays the navigation links one on top of the other. When the viewport grows to over 640 pixels the hamburger icon disappears and the links display in a single row. Finally, images respond to the viewport size and will not exceed the viewport&apos;s width.

While developing we used industry practices for setting up and organizing the HTML and CSS code so that it&apos;s easy to edit and maintain. Specifically we utilized SMACSS practices to organize CSS into separate files and appropriately ordered the loading of those files in the `<head>` of the HTML document.

## Getting Started
Steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine include: 
1. Open the GitHub page in a mobile browser (link coming soon)
1. Click the hamburger icon to display the navigation menu.
1. Open the same GitHub page in a desktop browser and notice the difference.
